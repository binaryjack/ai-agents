# React Multi-Agent Development System

A collaborative AI agent system designed to help developers build React applications efficiently through specialized, coordinated agents.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Agents

1. **Project Architect Agent** (`architect-agent`)
   - Analyzes requirements and creates project structure
   - Defines component hierarchy and data flow
   - Sets up development environment and tooling

2. **Component Generator Agent** (`component-agent`)
   - Creates React components based on specifications
   - Handles props, state, and lifecycle management
   - Generates both functional and class components

3. **Styling Agent** (`styling-agent`)
   - Implements CSS, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS
   - Ensures responsive design and accessibility
   - Maintains design system consistency

4. **State Management Agent** (`state-agent`)
   - Implements Redux, Zustand, or Context API
   - Manages global and local state patterns
   - Handles async state and side effects

5. **Testing Agent** (`testing-agent`)
   - Generates unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
   - Creates integration and E2E tests
   - Implements test-driven development patterns

6. **Performance Agent** (`performance-agent`)
   - Optimizes bundle size and loading performance
   - Implements code splitting and lazy loading
   - Monitors and improves Core Web Vitals

7. **API Integration Agent** (`api-agent`)
   - Handles REST and GraphQL integrations
   - Manages data fetching patterns
   - Implements caching strategies

8. **Deployment Agent** (`deployment-agent`)
   - Configures CI/CD pipelines
   - Handles build optimization
   - Manages environment configurations

### Agent Coordination

The **Orchestrator Agent** coordinates all specialized agents:
- Receives high-level requirements
- Delegates tasks to appropriate agents
- Ensures consistency across agent outputs
- Manages dependencies between agent tasks

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure your preferred React patterns in `config/preferences.json`
3. Run the orchestrator: `npm run start-orchestrator`
4. Interact with agents through the CLI or web interface

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start a new React project
npm run create-project "e-commerce dashboard"

# Generate a component
npm run generate-component "ProductCard" --props "product, onAddToCart"

# Add state management
npm run add-state "shopping-cart" --type "zustand"

# Generate tests
npm run generate-tests "ProductCard"
```

## Configuration

Customize agent behavior through `config/preferences.json`:
- Preferred component patterns
- Styling approach
- State management choice
- Testing strategies
- Code formatting rules

## Contributing

Each agent is designed to be modular and extensible. See `docs/agent-development.md` for creating new agents.
